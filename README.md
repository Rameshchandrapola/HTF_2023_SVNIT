## Inspiration
The need for a more efficient and transparent process for student chapters to obtain funds for events in colleges.

## What it does
It is a centralized platform would provide an easy way for the authority to track the use of funds and ensure accountability. Automates the process and it would ensure that the allocation of funds is fair and based on merit, and also save time for both the student chapters and the authority in charge of the funds.

## How we built it
Our project is built using a combination of technologies such as Hardhat for smart contract development, Solidity for writing the contracts, Metamask for interacting with the contracts on the Ethereum network, React for building the frontend. All these technologies came together to build a platform.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of this project, the team members have faced several challenges like Integrating Hardhat, Solidity and 5irechain. With a hackathon's timeline, managing time effectively and ensuring that the project was prototyped on time was a challenge for the team in order to provide the smooth experience for the user.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Giving importance to students in influencing the activities of the college and also working on our very first web3 project in the hackathon to try out something new.

## What we learned
We learned about many different sponsered technologies that we actually found useful during project development.

What's next for Peer Trust
This concept can be scaled up and developed in a way that we can reduce the high frequent gas fees by integrating the middleware of a basic central server and pushing the pool at once to blockchain. We can also try to implement multisig (multi signature) so the decision driving doesn't remain in hand of a single authority
